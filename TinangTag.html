		<h1 id="ssTitle">Server-Side Scripting: Back-End Web Development Technology</h1>
		<p class="def">
		Parts of Back end:
		<br>
		Server – serves as the powerful computer that runs the languages in the back end
		<br>
		Database – serve as the container or storage of the data
		<br>
		APIs – the one that controls the data and application a website shares with other applications
		<br>
		Back-end web application (server-side software) – includes the scripts and framework. What it does is to communicate between the Server, Database and the user with the help of languages. The Back-end web developers uses server-side script to create the server-side software of a website.

		<br>
		Server-side script basics
		<br>
		The script is embedded in the website’s code and it runs on a server. The script is intended to have a communication with the database and the information will be processed from the server to connect to the database. The facilitation of transferring data from server to the browser that bring pages to life in the browser is also the work of the Server-side script. The usual thing is that when a webpage is “called up” then it processes and turn back the data. On dynamic web applications, it empowers the functions like saving and getting the data and validation etc. It also creates APIs or application programming interfaces. 
		<br>
		Server-Side Databases and Code
		<br>
		It is designed to be seamless, smooth and fast. The flow of work would be the server-side scripting processes the wants or the request of the user depending on what they are looking via using the server and locate the data getting the exact line of data and eventually deliver the information back to the browser. These things will always happen with the help of the middleware which the back-end developer writes and the server-side application. These two builds a channel from the website to the database. What makes it fast and secure is when until it is requested the information for the website reside on the server.
		<br>
		Popular server-side languages
		<br>
		Java
		<br>
		It is considered as a subset of the language C. On its core is a variation of the C++ language with much easier curve of learning. Because of Java Virtual Machine, the platform of it is independent. It is very excellent for the enterprise level software, android apps and high-traffic sites. It comes with a very big ecosystem of software components which are add-ons.
		<br>
		PHP
		<br>
		PHP will allow you to make websites, create dynamic web pages and develop dynamic content. The language that is designed to edit and pull information from the database. It can do all sort of things like building custom web content to be able to serve the browser, and evaluate data that is send from the browser, and even sending or receiving cookies. It is usually connected with databases that are written in SQL Language. It is strictly designed for the web and very easy to deploy and install. PHP is the foundation for a lot of content-management systems such as WordPress. Wikipedia and Facebook are one of the powered sites by PHP.

		<h1 id="php">PHP</h1>
		<p class="def">
		The Php is very familiar to you because it seems like it is an old HTM. PHP code is written inside the “< ? php” and “?>”.  PHP is insensitive on whitespaces, but it is case sensitive. Its style for comments is like C Language. Statements are terminated through semicolons. The combination of tokens would be the expressions. To create a block, you make use of blocks. PHP has 8 data types used to create variables which the Integers, Doubles, Booleans, NULL, Strings, Arrays, Objects and lastly the Resources which is considered as special variables that hold references to the resources that are external to PHP. The Arrays and Objects are considered as compound that could be package up the other arbitrary values of the arbitrary type. PHP can be a local, function, global or static variable.
		<br>
		Example :
		<br>
		< div class="header">< h1>
			  <?php
		/* This is a multiline comment */
			  $welcome = "PHP Example !";
			  echo $welcome;
			  ?>
			</ h1></ div>

		<br>
		Comparisons used in PHP
		<br>
		List of comparison operators:
		<br>
		
		> means Greater than
		< means Less than
		<= means Less than or equal to
		>= means Greater than or equal to
		== means Equal to
		!= means Not equal to
		<br>
		Example :
		<br>
		< p>
		  < ?php
			6 < 7;
		  ?>
		</ p>
		<br>
		Conditional Control Flow Statements
		<br>
		if/elseif/else statement
		<br>
			It is created with the “if” keyword and the curly braces that always comes in pair. If the condition is true then the code inside the curly braces will run otherwise the conditions is false and after the keyword “else” on the second pair of curly braces will run.
		<br>
		Example :
		<br>
		< p>
			  <?php
				$items = 6
				if($items < 5) {
				  echo "You got a free coffee!";
				}else {
				  echo “You are not allowed to enter the coffee shop”
			   }
			  ?>
			</ p>
		<br>
		Switch statement
		<br>
		You can use it if you have a series of Conditional if-else statements that has multiple expressions that depend on the same value. It helps the programmer to be more efficient and provide readability. It executes a block of code is it is true like what is happening on if statements. It is created by using “switch” keyword then the variable to be checked and a pair of curly braces. For each comparison, there will be a case block and it uses break to make an exit in the switch statement. “Falling through” is the term if there are cases right after another without having a break. If the condition is not met, then another case block will run and if all of the cases return false then it will execute the default case instead.
		<br>
		Example :
		<br>
		 < ?php
			switch (20) {
				case 0:
					echo 'The value is 10';
					break;
				case 1:
					echo 'The value is 15';
					break;
				case 2:
					echo 'The value is 20';
					break;
				default:
					echo "The value isn't 10, 15 or 20";
			}
			?>
		<br>
		For Loops in PHP
		<br>
		We can use it to repeat a series of instructions instead of typing a lot of print of echo many times.  For the for loop in PHP, it will start with the “for” keyword to be followed by a set of parentheses. There are three things inside the parentheses and it is separated by a semicolon. The first things would be the start of the loop, second would be the place where to end the loop and the third would be the thing to do to get to the next iteration. After the parenthesis is a set of curly braces that will tell on what code will be run for every iteration of the loop.
		<br>
		Example:
		<br>
		This will print a list of leap years
		<br>
		< ?php
			  for ($leap = 2004; $leap < 2050; $leap = $leap + 4) {
				echo "<p>$leap</p>";
			  }
			 ?>
		<br>
		While Loop in PHP
		<br>
		As long as the condition is true, the while loop will execute. The syntax would be :
		<br>
		while(cond) {
		   // looped statements go here
		}
		<br>
		Where the cond is evaluated as true.
		<br>
		Example:
		<br>
		$count = 0;
		while ($count<4) {
		   echo "<p>Iteration number: {$count} </p>";
		   $count ++;
		}
		<br>
		Array
		<br>
		To store more than one item in only one variable, you make use of a text that starts with the $ sign to be followed by and = sign. For the declaration, we have to use array(). The array() will basically determine that $sample is an array and not a regular old variable.
		<br>
		Example :
		<br>
		< ?php
				$sample = array("Gusto", "ko", "na", “grumaduate” );        
			  ?>
		<br>
		
		PHP is very flexible , for the accessing of an array, you can make use either {} or [].
		To access by offset with [], you just must use echo function to be followed by the name of the array[numOfItem].
		To access by offset with {}, you just must use print function to be followed by the name of the array[numOfItem]. 
		We can access using its position.
		<br>
		Example :
		<br>
		echo $sample[0]
		<br>
		//The output would be “Gusto”
		<br>
		print $sample{1}
		<br>
		///The output would be “ko”
		<br>
		
		By assigning another value to a specific index, you can modify the array elements.
		<br>

		Example :
		<br>
		< ?php
				$sample = array("Gusto", "ko", "na", “grumaduate” );    
			echo $sample[0];
		//The output would be “Gusto”
		$sample[0] = “Ayaw”;
		echo $sample[0];
		//The output would be “Ayaw” because it was modified
			  ?>
		<br>
		To remove or delete array elements , you can make use of unset(toBeDeletedElement[position]) or unset(nameOfTheArray) to delete the whole array
		<br>
		Example :
		<br>
		< ?php
				$sample = array("Gusto", "ko", "na", “grumaduate” );   
				 unset($sample[2]);
			  ?>
		
		<br>OR
		<br>
		< ?php
		  unset($sample);
		?>
		
		<br>
		Functions in PHP
		<br>
		There are a lot of built-in functions in PHP. Here are some under String Functions:
		<br>
		Addcslashes,addslashes,bin2hex,chop,chr,chunk_split,convert_cyr_string,convert_uudecode,convert_uuencode,count_chars,crc32,crypt,echo,explode,fprintf,get_html_translation_table,hebrev,hebrevc,hex2bin,html_entity_decode,htmlentities,htmlspecialchars_decode,htmlspecialchars,implode,join,lcfirst,levenshtein,localeconv,ltrim,md5_file,md5,metaphone,money_format,nl_langinfo,nl2br,number_format,ord,parse_str,print,printf,quoted_printable_decode,quoted_printable_encode,quotemeta,rtrim,setlocale,sha1_file,sha1,similar_text,soundex,sprint,sscanf,str_getcsv,str_ireplace,str_pad,str_repeat,str_replace,str_rot13,str_shuffle,str_split,str_word_count,strcasecmp,strchr,strcmp,strcoll,strcspn,strip_tags,stripcslashes,stripos,stripslashes,stristr,strlen,strnatcasecmp,strnatcmp,strncasecmp,strncmp,strpbrk,strops,strrchr,strrev,strripos,strrpos,strspn,strstr,strtok,strtolower,strtoupper,strtr,substr_compare,substr_count,substr_replace,substr,trim,ucfirst,ucwords,vfprintf,vprintf,vsprintf, and wordwrap.
		<br>
		Example :
		<br>
		The function strlen returns the number of characters in a string
		<br>
		< ?php
		  // This will get the length of a string and will print it to the screen
		  $length = strlen("webtechlecture");
		  print $length;
		?>
		<br>
		There are also Math Functions that can be used in PHP. One example of these functions would be the round() which will round a number to an integer or to round off complex floating point numbers into a specific number of the decimal places.M_PI is equal to pi and it is considered as PHP Constant
		<br>
		Example :
		<br>
		// Round pi down from 3.1416...
		<br>
		$round = round(M_PI);
		<br>
		print $round;  // prints 3
		<br>

		// This time, round pi to 4 places
		<br>
		$round_decimal = round(M_PI, 4);
		<br>
		print $round_decimal; // prints 3.1416
		<br>
		Another Math Function is the rand() and you can optionally pass min and max as parameters. The  rand() function will return random numbers between two numbers.
		<br>
		Example :
		<br>
		// This will print a number between 0 and 32767
		<br>
		print rand();
		<br>
		// This will print a number between 1 and 10
		<br>
		print rand(1,10);
		<br>

		For the arrays, there are also functions that can be used like array_push() which will push or add elements at the end of the array and count() that will return the number of elements in the array in PHP. The sort() function will simply sort the elements in ascending manner in the array and its opposite is the rsort() which will sort the elements in descending manner.
		<br>

		Objects in PHP
		<br>
		PHP is an object-oriented programming language. The objects are very important when you are dealing with PHP and almost everything will be an object. Arrays and functions are object too.
		<br>
		Example :
		<br>
		The greet() method of the object $me is called
		<br>
		< ?php
				// The code below creates the class
				class Person {
					// Creating some properties 
		The variables are atied to an object

					public $isAlive = true;
					public $firstname;
					public $lastname;
					public $age;
					
					// For the assigning the values
					public function __construct($firstname, $lastname) {
					  $this->firstname = $firstname;
					  $this->lastname = $lastname;
					}
					
					// For the creation of a method where the function is tied to the object
					public function greet() {
					  return "Hello, my name is " . $this->firstname . " " . $this->lastname . ".";
					}
				  }
				// For printing out the greeting
				echo $me->greet(); 
				?>

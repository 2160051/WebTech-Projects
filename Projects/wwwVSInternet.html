	<h2>WWW vs. Internet</h2>
	<h2>WWW</h2>
	
	<p> "The Web exists because of programs which communicate between computers on the Net. The Web could not be without the Net. The Web made the net useful because people are really interested in information (not to mention knowledge and wisdom!) and don't really want to have know about computers and cables." - Tim Berners-Lee</p>
      <article class = "topic">
        <br>
        <p id="www_intro">The software part, which the World Wide Web can be called. It is a group of software services provided by and running on the internet. The information inside the Internet is the  World Wide Web. It is the collection of HTML pages that are offered on the internet. </p>
		<p id="www_description">To access the information from the various servers then the WWW uses HTTP Protocol. The the Hyper Text Transfer Protocol (HTTP) is the one in charge with the documents, linking of files, and other resources inside the World Wide Web. Through sending Web pages that is organized in the form of websites is the way on how the information is sent and these web pages are connected with each other by hyperlinks. 
		<br>
		By the Uniform Resource Locator address, one can determine the web pages and other pieces of information in WWW .</p>

	  <h2>Internet</h2>
      <article class = "topic">
        <br>
		<p id="internet_intro">
		The hardware part, which the Internet can be called. The Internet is identified as the collection of all hardware infrastructure existing in the network including routers, cables like fiber-optic, computer system, servers, bridges , satellites , cellular towers ,  copper wires, wireless connections and other more.
		</p>
		
		<p id="internet_description">Communications between its devices and a large variety of interactions , these are the things that the Internet network are fully supporting.
		<br>
		No one ever owns the Internet even the government. They have no rights and authority over its operations, it is free and it is an open broadcast medium of hardware networking.
		<br>
		Massive network of network, the Internet. It is an interconnection between a lot of smaller computer networks distributed around the world. By the use of underground cables, sub-oceanic cables ,satellite links,overground cables and  wireless signals and other more,these networks are interlinked with each other. The Internet Protocol which is dealing with the transmission in packets and data as a whole governs the Internet.
		<br>
		In order to view the World Wide Web, you have to access the Internet.

	<h1>Three Corner Stones</h1>
      <article class = "topic">
        <br>
		<p id="three_intro">It was October of 1990 when Tim Berners-Lee created the three corner stones that stood as the foundation of the modern day's World Wide Web. These three fundamental technologies are the things which people may have seen on parts of web browsers. 
		</p>
		<br>
		 <h2>HTTP</h2>
		<p id="http">Hypertext Transfer Protocol or HTTP was created for the World Wide Web and it is liked for its speed and simplicity. HTTP protocol requests the HTML document from the server and serves it to the browser.HTTP is responsible for the getting of linked resources from across the web.HTTP Protocol serves as the set of standards that allow people or users of the WWW to exchange data and information that are found on web pages. The "http://" in front of the address whenever users access the WWW tells the browser to make a connection to or communicate over HTTP. Some of the browsers in the modern world doesn't require "http://" in the front of the URL because of the reason that it is considered as the default method of communication . But it is also needed to separate it from other protocols like FTP that is why it is still kept in the browsers.
		</p>
		<br>
		<h2>HTTPS</h2>
		<p id="https">
		Hypertext Transfer Protocol Secure or HTTPS is a protocol that uses HTTP on a connection which is encrypted by the transport-layer security. To protect transmitted data from eavesdropping HTTP is used.For conducting financial transactions the HTTPS is the default protocol. HTTPS can also protect the users from censorship by an ISP or a government.
		</p>
		<br>
		<h2>HTML</h2>
		<p id="html">HyperText Markup Language or HTML is the markup language for the web for constructing electronic documents which are called pages. Each of pages that are displayed on the WWW contains a series of connections to other pages named "Hyperlinks". A browser would not know how to load images or display text as elements or other elements without the existence of HTML. HTML code always make sure the proper or right formatting of images and texts so that Internet browser will display these things as they are intended to look.People could think of HTML as the bones which represents the basic structure of a web page and CSS as its skin that represents the appearance when it is overlaid in the HTML.
		</p>
		<br>
		<h2>URL</h2>
		<p id="url">Uniform Resource Locator or URL is the unique address that determines where any given document that is living on the web or documents that are accessible over the Internet. It is a subset of URI and it is used to identify or locate to each resource through describing its primary access mechanism on the WWW. URL can be described as <protocol>://<node>/<location>. Example of URL would be https://www.facebook.com/, that is the URL for the Facebook Website.

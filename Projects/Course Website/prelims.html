		<h1 id="his">History of the World Wide Web</h1>
		<p id="hisDef"> 	
				In 1989, World Wide Web started by an English Physicist named Tim Berners-Lee. An
			organization called World Wide Web Consortium (W3C) at Massachusetts Institute of
			Technology (MIT) founded and still headed by Tim Berners-Lee and also participated in by
			several companies who are willing to create standards and ways to improve the quality of the
			Web. W3C also aims to provide access to the World Wide Web on the principle of no patent, no
			royalty due and easily adoptable by everyone. W3C has set the standards for HTML, XHTML,
			CSS and many other internet applications.

		<p id="timOp"> 1989 - Tim Berners-Lee's Opinion </p>
		<p id="timPar">	
				Tim Berners-Lee is an English Physicist who had been working
			since 1980 in Geneva for the (CERN) Conseil européen pour la
			recherche nucleaire. Anyhow, he was concerned and frustrated in
			sharing between many scientists at CERN for the reason that lack
			of information. And also the different platforms being used in
			communicating with each other becomes a barrier. So Tim
			Berners-Lee proposed his idea to create a new information system
			build on shared hypertext documents. 
		</p>
		<p id="dev"> 1990 - Development of the Project </p>
		<p id="devPar">	
				A basic software program that allows editing and viewing of hypertext documents was being developed. 
		</p>
		<p id="cern"> 1993 - The World Wide Web Continues Beyond CERN </p>
		<p id="cernPar">	
				WWW was made available and free to all, free of patents and royalties, opening up the Web to commercial use.
		</p>
		<p id="stone"> ◆ Three Cornerstones </p>
		<p id="stPar">
				It was October of 1990 when Tim Berners-Lee created the three corner stones that stood as the foundation 
			of the modern day's World Wide Web. These three fundamental technologies are the things which people may have seen 
			on parts of web browsers. 
		</p>
		<div id="containHTTP"><img src="pictures/http.png"></div>
		<p id="oneHTTP"> 1: Hypertext Transfer Protocol or HTTP </p>
		<p id="HTTPar">	
			HTTP was created for the World Wide Web and it is liked for its speed and simplicity. HTTP protocol requests the HTML document from 
			the server and serves it to the browser. HTTP is responsible for the getting of linked resources from across the web. HTTP Protocol 
			serves as the set of standards that allow people or users of the WWW to exchange data and information that are found on web pages. 
			The "http://" in front of the address whenever users access the WWW tells the browser to make a connection to or communicate over HTTP. 
			Some of the browsers in the modern world doesn't require "http://" in the front of the URL because of the reason that it is considered as 
			the default method of communication. But it is also needed to separate it from other protocols like FTP that is why it is still kept in the 
			browsers.	 
		</p>
		<p id="HTTPSPar">	
			Hypertext Transfer Protocol Secure or HTTPS is a protocol that uses HTTP on a connection which is encrypted by the transport-layer security. 
			To protect transmitted data from eavesdropping HTTP is used. For conducting financial transactions the HTTPS is the default protocol. 
			HTTPS can also protect the users from censorship by an ISP or a government.	 
		</p>
		<p id="twoHTML"> 2: Hypertext Markup Language or HTML </p>
		<div id="containHTML"><img src="pictures/html.png"></div>
		<p id="HTMLPar">	
			HTML is a markup language for the web used for constructing electronic documents which are called pages. Each of the pages that are displayed on 
			the WWW contains a series of connections to other pages named "Hyperlinks". A browser would not know how to load images or display text as elements 
			or other elements without the existence of HTML. HTML code always make sure the proper or right formatting of images and texts so that 
			Internet browser will display these things as they are intended to look. People could think of HTML as the bones which represents the basic 
			structure of a web page and CSS as its skin that represents the appearance when it is overlaid in the HTML.	 
		</p>
		<p id="threeURL"> 3: Uniform Resource Locator or URL </p>
		<div id="containURL"><img src="pictures/URL.png"></div>
		<p id="URLPar">	
			URL is the unique address that determines where any given document that is living on the web or documents that are accessible over the Internet. 
			It is a subset of URI and it is used to identify or locate to each resource through describing its primary access mechanism on the WWW. 
			URL can be described as <protocol>://<node>/<location>. Example of a URL would be https://www.facebook.com/ which is the URL for the 
			website Facebook.	 
		</p>
		<p id="vers"> ◆ WWW vs. Internet </p>
		<p id="versWWW"> 
				<strong>WWW</strong> - also called the World Wide Web, is a group of software services provided by the Internet. 
			The information inside the Internet is the World Wide Web. It is the collection of HTML pages that are offered on the Internet. 
			To access information from the various servers, the WWW uses HTTP Protocol. The Hyper Text Transfer Protocol (HTTP) is the one 
			in charge with the documents, linking of files, and other resources inside the World Wide Web. Through sending Web pages, organized 
			in the form of websites, is the way how information is sent. These web pages are connected to each other by hyper links. 
			Using the Uniform Resource Locator address, one can determine the web pages and other pieces of information in WWW.	 
		</p>
		<p id="versInter"> 
				<strong>Internet</strong> - is identified as the collection of all hardware infrastructure existing in the network including routers, 
			cables like fiber-optic, computer system, servers, bridges, satellites, cellular towers,  copper wires, wireless connections and more. 
			Communication between its devices and a large variety of interactions, are things that the Internet fully supports. 
			No one owns the Internet, not even the government. They have no rights and authority over its operations, it is free and it is an open broadcast 
			medium of hardware networking. It is an interconnection between a lot of smaller computer networks 
			distributed around the world. By the use of underground cables, sub-oceanic cables, satellite, links, over ground cables, wireless signals and 
			more, these networks are interlinked with each other. The Internet Protocol, which deals with the transmission of packets and data as a 
			whole governs the Internet. In order to view the World Wide Web, you have to access the Internet.

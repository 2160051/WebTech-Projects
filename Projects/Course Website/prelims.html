		<p id="hisDef"> 	
				In 1989, World Wide Web started by an English Physicist named Tim Berners-Lee. An
			organization called World Wide Web Consortium (W3C) at Massachusetts Institute of
			Technology (MIT) founded and still headed by Tim Berners-Lee and also participated in by
			several companies who are willing to create standards and ways to improve the quality of the
			Web. W3C also aims to provide access to the World Wide Web on the principle of no patent, no
			royalty due and easily adoptable by everyone. W3C has set the standards for HTML, XHTML,
			CSS and many other internet applications.

		<p id="timOp"> 1989 - Tim Berners-Lee's Opinion </p>
		<p id="timPar">	
				Tim Berners-Lee is an English Physicist who had been working
			since 1980 in Geneva for the (CERN) Conseil européen pour la
			recherche nucleaire. Anyhow, he was concerned and frustrated in
			sharing between many scientists at CERN for the reason that lack
			of information. And also the different platforms being used in
			communicating with each other becomes a barrier. So Tim
			Berners-Lee proposed his idea to create a new information system
			build on shared hypertext documents. 
		</p>
		<p id="dev"> 1990 - Development of the Project </p>
		<p id="devPar">	
				A basic software program that allows editing and viewing of hypertext documents was being developed. 
		</p>
		<p id="cern"> 1993 - The World Wide Web Continues Beyond CERN </p>
		<p id="cernPar">	
				WWW was made available and free to all, free of patents and royalties, opening up the Web to commercial use.
		</p>
		<p id="stone"> ◆ Three Cornerstones </p>
		<p id="stPar">
				It was October of 1990 when Tim Berners-Lee created the three corner stones that stood as the foundation 
			of the modern day's World Wide Web. These three fundamental technologies are the things which people may have seen 
			on parts of web browsers. 
		</p>
		<div id="containHTTP"><img src="pictures/http.png" alt="HTTP"></div>
		<p id="oneHTTP"> 1: Hypertext Transfer Protocol or HTTP </p>
		<p id="HTTPar">	
			HTTP was created for the World Wide Web and it is liked for its speed and simplicity. HTTP protocol requests the HTML document from 
			the server and serves it to the browser. HTTP is responsible for the getting of linked resources from across the web. HTTP Protocol 
			serves as the set of standards that allow people or users of the WWW to exchange data and information that are found on web pages. 
			The "http://" in front of the address whenever users access the WWW tells the browser to make a connection to or communicate over HTTP. 
			Some of the browsers in the modern world doesn't require "http://" in the front of the URL because of the reason that it is considered as 
			the default method of communication. But it is also needed to separate it from other protocols like FTP that is why it is still kept in the 
			browsers.	 
		</p>
		<p id="HTTPSPar">	
			Hypertext Transfer Protocol Secure or HTTPS is a protocol that uses HTTP on a connection which is encrypted by the transport-layer security. 
			To protect transmitted data from eavesdropping HTTP is used. For conducting financial transactions the HTTPS is the default protocol. 
			HTTPS can also protect the users from censorship by an ISP or a government.	 
		</p>
		<p id="twoHTML"> 2: Hypertext Markup Language or HTML </p>
		<div id="containHTML"><img src="pictures/html.png" alt="HTML"></div>
		<p id="HTMLPar">	
			HTML is a markup language for the web used for constructing electronic documents which are called pages. Each of the pages that are displayed on 
			the WWW contains a series of connections to other pages named "Hyperlinks". A browser would not know how to load images or display text as elements 
			or other elements without the existence of HTML. HTML code always make sure the proper or right formatting of images and texts so that 
			Internet browser will display these things as they are intended to look. People could think of HTML as the bones which represents the basic 
			structure of a web page and CSS as its skin that represents the appearance when it is overlaid in the HTML.	 
		</p>
		<p id="threeURL"> 3: Uniform Resource Locator or URL </p>
		<div id="containURL"><img src="pictures/URL.png" alt="URL"></div>
		<p id="URLPar">	
			URL is the unique address that determines where any given document that is living on the web or documents that are accessible over the Internet. 
			It is a subset of URI and it is used to identify or locate to each resource through describing its primary access mechanism on the WWW. 
			URL can be described as &#60;protocol&#62;://&#60;node>/&#60;location&#62;. Example of a URL would be https://www.facebook.com/ which is the URL for the 
			website Facebook.

      				1.	GET – retrieves, transfers a selected resource into the message body aka entity. Commonly used method (RFC 7231, Sec. 4.3.1) (RFC 2616, Sec. 9.3). <br><br>
      				2.	HEAD – identical to get but doesn’t get the resource. It has no payload, only headers and metadata (RFC 7231, Sec. 4.3.2) (RFC 2616, Sec. 9.4).<br><br>
      				3.	POST – non-safe and non-idempotent method. It is utilized for processing resources from the payload given by a request (RFC 7231, Sec. 4.3.3) (RFC 2616, Sec. 9.5).<br><br>
      				-	Typically used in HTML form data.<br><br>
      				-	Any data that is being submitted is already in the payload aka message body and the information will not be in the URL.<br>
      				*Search-friendly URL – doesn’t contain any query.<br><br>
      				4.	PUT – utilized to modify all existing models of the resource being targeted by basing it from the payload contained by the request (RFC 7231, Sec. 4.3.4) (RFC 2616, Sec. 9.6).<br><br>
      				-	Web servers, by default, do not allow put request since it may affect the information.<br>
      				5.	DELETE – logically removes the relationship existing between the resource being targeted and its existing functions. It does not necessarily delete the true resource hence it may be modified by a human intervening from the server which has the true copy (RFC 2616, Sec. 9.7) (RFC 7231, Sec 4.3.5).<br><br>
      				6.	OPTIONS – allows you to query a particular resource on the server itself. Its response is usually other request methods. It is another way of ensuring the integrity of a resource.<br><br>
      				*A request may be noted as an asterisk (*) wherein it represents a global or general resource (RFC 7231, Sec. 4.3.7) (RFC 2616, Sec. 9.2).<br><br>
      				7.	TRACE – echoes back to the user or client what is happening to the request or received request message. It can manipulate the message (RFC 7231, Sec. 4.3.8) (RFC 2616, Sec. 9.8).<br><br>
      				-	Typically used for testing, diagnosing the request, response chain and troubleshooting.
      				*Response chain – set of nodes from client to server.<br><br>
      				8.	CONNECT – set ups the connection to the requested server of the resource being targeted (RFC 7231, Sec. 4.3.6) (RFC 2616, Sec. 9.9).<br>
					<br>
      				*Link Rot – linking to different pages but these pages aren’t controlled by you so some links may not exist anymore and if not updated, the website will degrade due to dead links. Solution: Update.<br><br>

		<p id="rfcTitle"> ◆ RFCs</p>
		<p id="rfc"> <b>Request for Comments (RFC) for HTTP</b>
           <p id="rfc1">Request for comments, also called RFCs started ascending on April 7, 1969 invented by Steve Crocker together with the introduction 
		   of host-to-host and IMP software. These are also known to be the notes that cover information about computer communication, programs, procedures 
		   network protocols and others. Every covered information will have a number corresponding to it. In case there would be another version of a certain 
		   RFC, another number will be associated with it. The index of the notes are available online at the site: https://www.rfc-editor.org/rfc-index.html
		   </p>
           <p id="rfc2">The first RFC for Hypertext Transfer Protocol – HTTP 1.0 was published in May 1996 by Tim Berners-Lee, Roy Fielding and Henrik 
		   Frystyk. The specification defines the features that would indicate the common usage of the protocol. Basic rules and syntax were stated in the 
		   notes like the Request, Response, Method, Status code and Header Field definitions and usage. Another proposed standard is the RFC-2068 which 
		   describes another version of HTTP which is the HTTP 1.1.</p>  
           <p id="rfc3">HTTP 1.1 was described in the RFC-2616 that included updated definition and usage. Furthermore RFCs 7230-7235 defined more 
		   features: Message Syntax and Routing, Semantics and Content, Conditional Requests, Range Requests, Caching, and Authentication. In May 2000, 
		   another RFC was published with a reference number 2817 which imposed an upgrade to TLS Transport Layer Security which allows both http and 
		   https access the same port of 80 instead of port 80 for http and port 443 for https. There were also mandatory upgrade and mandatory 
	       advertisement imposed in this RFC version.</p>  
           <p id="rfc4">HTTP version later on was defined in RFC-7540 that added features like allowing the users to send multiple request and eliminating 
		   head-of-line blocking. Header compression for HTTP/2.0 was also added and stated in the RFC-7541 by the use of HPACK.</p>  
		<h1 id="hTML">HTML</h1>
		<p id="htmlDef">
			The term HTML is an acronym for HyperText Markup Language. It is a markup language used for creating Web pages in World Wide Web.  
			It is actually a product or application of SGML (Standard Generalized Markup Language) which is a specialization of something more general for 
			the markup language.SGML is a language that define a markup language.Basically, HTML provides the structure, lay-out, content and format of a 
			Web pages.<br>
			<br>Initially it was developed at :<br>
			▶	CERN <br>
			▶	IETF <br>
			▶	W3C <br>
			▶	WHATWG <br>
			<br>
			HTML is used purely for semantic specification of structure in Web pages.

		<h1 id="hisMe">HTML BASIC STRUCTURE</h1>	
			<p id="subtitle">DOCTYPE</p>
			<p id="htmldes">
			&#60;!DOCTYPE HTML&#62; which is usually found at the very top of the page before any HTML tags, is called a document type declaration that identifies the document and tells the browser that it is in HTML5 version. This doc type should appear only once at the beginning of the code and the declaration is not case sensitive. &#60;!DOCTYPE HTML&#62; helps the browsers to display the pages of the web in a correct manner or way.
			</p>
			<p id="subtitle">HTML Root Element</p>
			<p id="htmldes">
			The &#60;HTML&#62; serves as the root element that defines the whole HTML document. It holds all of the code and wraps the content in the HTML document. It identifies which the web page is written in HTML. It usually contains each of &#60;head&#62; and &#60;body&#62; elements. The &#60;/HTML&#62; tag is the sign that it is the end of the web page. When a web developer used element something like this, &#60;HTML lang="en"&#62;, it means that it declares that language of the document is English. </p>
			<p id="subtitle">ELEMENTS AND TAGS</p>
			<p id="htmldes">
			To mark up or create the content, elements and tags always work together. HTML elements role is to identify the importance of a tag. Tag determines the start and the end of an element, the thing that is inside of each element is called content. Not all of the elements are required to have an end tag like &#60;br&#62;. For each and every element, it has its meaning like example &#60;p&#62; Content &#60;/p&#62;, the &#60;p&#62; element is used whenever a web developer will write a paragraph.
			There are two main parts for every HTML document. The &#60;head&#62; and &#60;body&#62; elements have both end tags. The &#60;head&#62; element is responsible in containing the meta information of the HTML document and the &#60;title&#62; element that is the only element required to be put inside the &#60;head&#62; tags which indicates the title for the document or simply specifies the web page title.  This &#60;head&#62; element could also include a lot of HTML elements that that cannot be seen as parts of the page when rendered by the browser. These elements are either meta data or are the things that is helping in pulling the external resources like JavaScript files or CSS style sheets. The HTML elements which can be used by a web developer that can be put inside the &#60;head&#62; element are the &#60;base&#62;, &#60;link&#62;, &#60;noscript&#62;, &#60;style&#62;, &#60;meta&#62;, &#60;title&#62; and the &#60;script&#62;. 
			The &#60;body&#62; element serves as a container of the content of a web page that defines the HTML document body, it is considered as the information that a person want to display in a web page. The &#60;body&#62; element should be only one therefore all of the things that a user can see whenever the browser is rendered is contained in the &#60;body&#62; element. </p>
			<p id="subtitle">COMMENTS</p>
			<p id="htmldes">
			Web developers can easily understand each other specially when one of them will give a guide through the use of comments, comments in HTML starts with "&#60;!--" and ends with " --&#62;".
			These comments are ignored and not seen by users whenever the web page is rendered.</p>

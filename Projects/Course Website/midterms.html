		<p class="def">
		Developers had many ideas regarding how the elements could be presented out in the web since HTML did not have any method of styling pages. Although it was not part of Berners-Lee’s motivation, there were few languages for web page layout and CSS was the chosen to be published in December of 1996. It is also known as Cascading Style Sheets is a stylesheet language that is used to describe the appearance of a document in terms of how the HTML elements are presented. 
		</p>
       
		<div id="weblay"><h2 class="head2">◆ Web Page Layout</h2></div>

		<h3 class="head3">A. ViolaWWW Browser</h3>
		<p class="css">
		- It was created by Take Pei-Yuan Wei in 1991<br>
		- It was a stylesheet incorporated into his own browser <br>
		- It has the basic navigation features such as bookmark list, and history list that allows one to traverse the documents automatically.<br>
		- It is an extensible World Wide Web hypermedia browser that supports interactive objects and features like stylesheets and tables.<br>
		- It did not succeed to be a standard, but it was one of the style sheet inspiration for today’s specifications.<br>
        </p>
		
		<h3 class="head3">B. Netscape Navigator</h3>
		<p class="css">
		- It was developed by Marc Andreessen  on October 13th 1994<br>
		- It was extended HTML language which includes presentational and unstandardized HTML.<br>
		</p>
		<h3 class="head3">C. Cascading HTML Style Sheets</h3>
		<p class="css">
		- It was proposed by Håkon Wium Lie in October 1994<br>
		- It supported multiple stylesheet viewing to maintain personal-freedom of the web.<br>
		- It was further simplified and was published as CSS spec in December of 1996<br>
		</p>
		<h2 class="head2">◆ Cascading Style Sheet (CSS) as a Specification</h2>
		  <img id="hakonWL" src="pictures/HakonWL.jpg">
          <p id="hwl">Håkon Wium Lie</p>
          <p id="hwlp">
            Håkon Wium Lie is a Norwegian web pioneer is known to be the Father of CSS. He proposed the concept of Cascading Style Sheets (CSS) in 1994 while working with the Tim Berners-Lee at CERN. Variuos ideas were already proposed before CSS, which aims to be the standard way of suggesting how the users would like the web pages appear. Before it was finally published, it was known as the Cascading HTML Style Sheets (CHSS) and it seemed to need improvement. Then after simplifing his proposal, it was then published successfully and is now continuously being utilized by developers with the certainty that it will function across browsers seamlessly</p>
       
		<h2 class="head2">CSS Levels</h2>
		<h3 class="head3">▶ CSS Level 1</h3>
		<p class="css">CSS 1 specification is considered obsolete by the CSS Working Group as it was the first specification established. It was described as a simple style sheet mechanism which allows the users to include styles like colors and fonts to HTML documents. Multiple stylesheets from different users is supported to cater their needs and preferences.</p> 
		<p class="css">There were basic concepts included in this level of recommendation such as the containment in HTML defining how HTML and style sheets can be linked. Grouping was also included to reduce the style sheet’s size.a To have the same function with the parent element, inheritance can be used. In this case, any element that did not have any assigned style will inherit the style of its parents. In this level, selectors can either be a class, an ID or a context. Lastly, comments were included for the developers’ use and it formatted similarly to C programming language.</p>
		<p class="css">Pseudo-classes and pseudo-elements in CSS1 extend addressing to allow eternal information take effect with the formatting process. These are Anchor pseudo-classes, Typographical pseudo-elements, the 'first-line' pseudo-element, the 'first-letter' pseudo-element, Pseudo-elements in selectors, and Multiple pseudo-elements. The CSS1 supposes that each formatted element results in rectangular boxes. Elements can either be formatted as block-level or inline. Different style properties can have any value assignment. These style properties are font, color, text, box, and classification properties.</p> 
		<h3 class="head3">▶ CSS level 2</h3>
		<p class="css">CSS level 2 had several problems detected though it already passed the recommendation stage. CSS level 2.1 was then specified. The problems were addressed by maintaining the compatibility with the widely accepted CSS2 and removing CSS2 features that were rejected by the CSS community. Conventions were added such as conventions of document language elements and attributes where it is stated that CSS values should be delimited by single quotes while language attributes should be delimited by double quotes. Property definitions contains key information including value, initial, applies to, inherited, percentage values, media groups and computed value. A property can also be specified as a shorthand property which means that authors can specify the values of properties with a single property.</p> 
		<h3 class="head3">▶ CSS level 3</h3>
		<p class="css">Module by module, CSS 3 forms on CSS level 2 and adds functionalities to CSS 2.1. It was in the level 3 when selectors were defined furthermore. These selectors represent structure which can be used as a condition. Selector syntax is also case sensitive within the ASCII range depending on the document language. A selector is a chain of simple selector/s that are delimited by combinators which begins with a type selector or universal selector.  This simple selector is either a universal selector, type selector, attribute selector, class selector, ID selector, or pseudo-class. Additionally, a list of selectors delimited by comma represent the combination of elements selected by each selector. The combinators can be identified as either a descendant combinator, child combinatory or a sibling combinator accordin to this level.</p> 
		<p class="css">The specificity is the process of which the browsers decide what CSS property values are the most important to a specific element, and consequently will be operated. A selector’s specificity can be calculated according to the following CSS3 recommendation: <br>
		- the count of ID selectors in the selector<br>
		- the count of class selectors, attributes selectors, and pseudo-classes in the selector<br>
		- the count of type selectors and pseudo-elements in the selector<br>
		- ignore the number of universal selector<br>
		</p>
		<h3 class="head3">▶ CSS level 4</h3>
		<p class="css">Extending the level 3, level 4 entitled Selectors Level 4 have been improved and designed to be usable in accordance to performance-critical code. Aside from simple selector, it has now a type of selector which is called compound selector. This selector is not separated by a combinator and represents a set of conditions on a single element. A complex selector, on the other hand, is a sequence of compound selector/s separated by combinator.</p>
		<p class="css">Document Object Model, also known as DOM, is used for evaluating selectors which can result into document tree or source document. Selectors such as scoped selector and relative selector are included in level 4. Namespace prefixes are supported by selectors in this level as well. These namespace prefixes are declared with the ‘@namespace’ rule as indicated. Error handling is already included and must be observed by the user agents. Another feature inlcuded was Logical combinators and User action pseudo classes.</p>
		<p class="css">For time-dimensional Pseudo-classes, there are three classifications that describes the elements’ state in a timeline. The Current-element Pseudo-class, Past-element Pseudo-class and Future-element Pseudo-class are the three classifications that was described earlier. Input Pseudo-classes are also included such as the input control states, input value states and input value-checking that are mainly used for the users’ input. Lastly, the tree-structural pseudo-classes is used to select based on the information in the document tree which cannot be represented by a combinatory or a simple selector. The child-indexed and the typed child-indexed pseudo classes were also included.</p>
		
		<h2 class="head3">HTML Style Sheets</h1>
		<p class="css">
		HTML style sheet is a source of styles for the HTML documents.
		A style sheet control the appearance or aspect and layout or multi elements on the webpage, also the webpage design to avoid redundancy by a set of commands. <br>
		<br>
		▶ Author styles 
		<br>
		a.	It recommends to use external style sheet also known as linked. <br>
		b.	It can also use embedded style sheet also known as internal. <br>
		c.	It is an inline style. <br>
		▶ User styles
		<br>
		a.	In some browsers provide non-standard alternatives through extensions or plugins. <br>
		▶ User agent styles
		<br>
		a.	It is a sample default user agent style sheet from CSS 2.1
		</p>
		<h2 class="head4">Three types of Style sheets</h2>
		<p class="css">
		1. Internal – it is a type of stylesheet that is defined within a &#60;style&#62; tag and in the HTML document it is embedded in the &#60;head&#62; portion.
		<br>
		2.	External – it is a type of stylesheet that which have a css extention and it use &#60;link&#62; tag in the HTML file.
		<br>
		3.	Inline – it is a type of stylesheet that is placed or written inside of the HTML file using a style attribute within an element’s tag.
		</p>
		<div id="cssStat"><h2 class="head2">◆ CSS Statements</h2></div>
		<p class="def">
		CSS Statements are building blocks that start with any non-space character and ends with a semi-colon. <br>
		<br>
		Kinds of Statement
		<br>
		▶ Rulesets – also known as rules. It consist of a selector which associate CSS declarations collection to a condition. <br>
		▶ At-rules – it begins with an ‘@’ at sign symbol with an identifier. <br>
		<br>
		Identifiers
		<br>
		@charset – it is used in the stylesheet which specify the character. <br>
		@import – it import style rules in another stylesheet. <br>
		@namespace - it is used to restrict the type, universal and attribute selectors. <br>
		@media – it is used to apply styles from one or more media. <br>
		@supports – it is also called a feature query. <br>
		@page- when printing a document, it is used to modify CSS properties. <br>
		@font-face – it allows authors to use or specify fonts.<br>
		</p>
		<div id="cssSelect"><h2 class="head2">◆ CSS Selectors</h2></div>
		<p class="css">
		CSS Selectors are used to define a style for an element or a group of elements.
		</p>
		<h3 class="head3">Simple Selectors</h3>
		<p class="def">
		1. Type Selector <br>
		- the type selector applies styling through utilizing the name of an element. When used, styling will be applied to all instances of the element. <br>
		2. Class Selector <br>
		- the class selector uses the name specified in a class attribute. Styling using the class selector is done by placing a ‘.’ character before the class name. <br> 
		3. ID Selector <br>
		- the ID selector applies style on an element based on the name specified in an ID attribute. The syntax ‘#’ followed by the ID name is followed when specifying styling using an ID name. <br>
		4. Universal Selector <br>
		- the universal selector (*) is applicable for styling elements of any type. All elements can be selected or may be narrowed based on need. <br>
		5. Attribute Selector <br>
		- the attribute selector works for applying style based on an attribute or a specified value of an attribute. <br>
		</p>
		<h3 class="head3">Combinators</h3>
		<p class="css">
		Combinators specify relationships between selectors and are be used to be more specific with element selection.
		</p>
		<p class="def">
		1. Descendant combinator ( ) <br>
		- the descendant combinator selects the descendants of the first element.<br>
		2. Child combinator (>)<br>
		- the child combinator selects the direct children of the first element.<br>
		3. Adjacent sibling combinator (+)<br>
		- the adjacent sibling combinator selects adjacent siblings of an element. <br>
		4. General sibling combinator (~)<br>
		- the general sibling combinator selects elements that are siblings of another specified element. <br>
		</p>
		<h3 class="head3">Pseudo-classes and Pseudo-elements </h3>
		<p class="defTwo">
		Elements can also be styled according to their state. Pseudo-classes allow elements to be selected based on other information about the element. An example would be styling the appearance of a button when hovered on or clicked. This uses the ‘:’ symbol. If the web designer wants to specify an element based on its position then pseudo-elements can be used. Pseudo-elements use the ‘::’ symbol and can select an element based on its position. An example would be selecting the first line of a paragraph and such. 
		</p>
		<h3 class="head3">Selector group</h3>
		<p class="defTwo">
		Styling different elements with one style block is possible with the selector group. Multiple selectors, separated by a comma or the ‘,’ symbol, can be used to style different instances of elements. 
		</p>
		<div id="cssRule"><h2 class="head2">◆ CSS Rule Precedence</h2></div>
		<p class="css">
		For the reason that specified styles might clash because elements could be stylized by different selectors, the CSS rule precedence is followed. Prioritizing a style is done to resolve conflict.
		</p>
		<h3 class="head3">Three ways on how conflict is resolved:</h3>
		<p class="def">
		1. Origin and Importance<br>
		- Styles can be prioritized based from its origins and whether or not it uses the !important property. <br>
		<br> 2. Specificity <br>
		- The more specific the selector for a style is, the more it is prioritized. <br>
		<br> 3. Order <br>
		- Inline styles are prioritized but if an external CSS is used, the later declaration based on line number will be prioritized. <br>
		</p>
		
		<div id="cssDec"><h2 class="head2">◆CSS Declarations</h2></div>
			<p class="css">
			CSS Declarations are formed through properties, which are defined thru values. These blocks of declaration combined with selectors then altogether create rule sets (CSS Properties, n.d.).
			<br><br>
			▶ Properties: <br>
			1. Shorthand properties - collection of values which allows identifying several elements. As stated in its definition on the CSS specification, shorthand properties identify and groups together properties which targets or define the same object. This then makes developers to work on the style sheet more efficiently (Shorthand properties, 2018). <br>
			Example: border properties, margin properties <br> 
			<b>Note:</b> In this code, the background color will be overridden by the Doge.png image. <br></p>
 			<div class="codeID">
 			<code>background-color: red; <br>
 			background: url(“Doge.png”); <br></code>
 			</div>
 			<p class="css">
 			Explanation: If you don’t set the values properly, they are sent back to their initial value <br>
			▶ Additional Information: <br>
			CSS is capable of universally defining the value of each and every property in the style sheet by utilizing the universal shorthand property which is all.<br><br>
			▶ Universal Property Values:<br>
			1. inherit – inherits the value from its origin element, otherwise known as parent element.<br>
			2. initial – it defines the value of the property by the default value of the browser’s local style sheet.<br>
			3. unset – makes the value of the property to its original value.<br>
			4. revert – it reverts the value of the property back to its form of origin by basing it to the style sheet of the user. If the user’s style sheet is not made available, the default style sheet from the user-agent is utilized.<br>
			Source: (Shorthand properties, 2018) <br><br>

			2. Vendor-specific extensions - used by browser vendors as a prefix for the names of experimental or non-standard CSS. Only after the extensions are standardized will the prefix be removed and stated as is. Although this is the case, browser vendors are veering away from it in order to put user-controlled flags or preferences. It is denoted by the character ‘-’ followed by the identifier that the browser vendor used and anoder ‘-‘ then a name which identifies what the property will do (Roberts, 2014). <br>
			Example: -moz-opacity, -webkit-transition, -opera-animation <br><br>
			3. Custom properties - aka CSS variables (experimental). These are customized properties indicated by the characters (--) as the prefix.<br>
 			Example: <br>
			1. fallback value - in case there is no defined variable, a default value or fallback value is utilized.<br>
			2. As a code:<br>
		 	<div class="codeID">
		 	<code>
		 	:root{<br>
			--kulay: rgb(255, 0, 0);<br>
			}<br>
			#backgroundInColor{<br>
			background-color: var(--kulay);<br>
			}<br>
		 	</code>

					2. Cascaded Value – a value produced by the process of cascading. <br>
					3. Specified Value - every element has one specified value. It is created by processing cascaded value to the processes involving defaulting values.<br>
					4. Computed Value - calculated value as a result from a given set of elements.<br>
					5. Used Value - actual value used in a specified condition. This is created by processing computed value through different calculations then comparing it to a set of accepted values.<br>

			▶ Additional information:<br>
			*Color Theory - sets the basic understanding for the associating colors with contrast, complementation and vibrancy.<br>
			*Contrast - sets the background and foreground apart by separating the colors used. <br>
			*Complementation - subjective way of relating colors with one another by choosing which combination of colors is visually appealing to the eye of the beholder.<br>
			*Vibrancy - refers to how the colors evoke emotions. This means that the brighter the color, the more energy it evokes while darker colors evokes less energy and more towards relaxing the viewer’s mind.<br>
			<br>▶ Effective Color Scheme:<br>
			1. Triadic Color Scheme - colors which form an equilateral triangular shape in the color wheel compliments one another and have balanced vibrancy.<br>

		<div id="watis"><h2 class="head2">◆ What is JavaScript?</h2></div>
		<p class="def">
		Javascript is a lightweight and dynamic computer programming language. It is a part of web pages that has an implementations of creating dynamic pages and 
		allows client-side script to have a contact with the user. It is an object-oriented scripting language and cross-platform that is commonly used to create 
		webpages interactive like clickable buttons , complex animations and popup menus. Array, Date, and Math which are standard library of objects are included in JavaScript. JavaScript also contain the statements, operators and control structures which are termed as the core set of language elements. 
		By supplementing additional objects, the core JavaScript could be extended for different kinds of goals or purposes. The meaning of this is that in our web browser, the power of changing the way the webpage looks like is handled by JavaScript.
		</p>
		<h3 class="head3">Client-side JavaScript</h3>
		<p class="css">
		It extends the language by the way of giving objects to control browsers and each of its Document Object Model. For example, its extensions it permits an 
		application to put elements in an HTML form and it responds on to the user events like page navigation, mouse clicks, and form input.
		</p>
		<h3 class="head3">Server-side JavaScript</h3>
		<p class="css">
		It extends the language by the way of giving objects important to running JavaScript on servers. 
		For example,its extensions gives continuity of information from one invocation to another invocation of the application, performs on 
		servers file manipulations or allows interaction of applications with a database.

		<div id="javascriptpic"><img src="pictures/javascript.png" alt="JavaScript Logo"></div>
		<p id="cssjavascript">
		<b>JAVASCRIPT</b> <br>
		It is Object-oriented. Between types of objects, there are no distinction. You can dynamically add methods and properties to any object and through the prototype mechanism, the idea of inheritance is implemented.
		In javaScript, there are no times where there is declaration of variable data types. It implements dynamic typing and it is loosely typed. You can not automatically write something to hard disk in JavaScript.

		<div id="javapic"><img src="pictures/java.jpg" alt="Java Logo"></div>
		<p id="cssjava">
		<b>JAVA</b> <br>
		Unlike in JavaScript, the declaration of variable data types is very important. It implements static typing and it os strongly typed. Java is class based and the objects are separated into Classes and instances considering all of the inheritance through the hierarchy of the class. You can not add 
		dynamically the methods or properties in the classes and instances. Unlike in JavaScript, in Java you can automatically write into the hard disk.

		<p class="css">
		1. Core JavaScript(EcmaScript) Language and API <br>
		- ECMAScript is commonly used on non-browser environments such as node.js. <br>
		<br>2. Browser Object Model API <br>
		- Browser Object Model (BOM) has no official standards. The modern browsers nowadays have implemented almost the same properties and methods for JavaScript interactivity that is why it is often known as properties and methods of the BOM. <br>
		<br>3. Document Object Model API<br>
		- The Document Object Model is an independent on language convention for interacting and representing with objects in XHTML, XML  and  HTML documents. <br>
		<br>4. Miscellaneous JavaScript Web APIs<br>
		- Some important miscellaneous javaScript web APIs are IndexDB, Geolocation, Push Notification ,Local Storage, Web Sockets,Web workers, Service Workers, XMLHttpRequest(AJAX) etc. <br>

		<div id="howjavas"><h2 class="head2">◆ How to use JavaScript?</h2></div>
		<p class="css">
		JavaScript is very fussy and case sensitive.
		The &#60;script&#62; element is the only friend of JavaScript in the world of HTML. JavaScript has two kinds: <br>
		</p>
		<h3 class="head5">Internal JavaScript</h3>
		<p class="css">
		The script can be placed in the HTML file.
		</p>
		<p class="codeID">
		<code>&#60;script&#62;<br>
		// The JavaScript goes here and the script should be added just before the closing of the body. <br>
		&#60;/script&#62;</code>
		</p>
		<h3 class="head5">External JavaScript</h3>
		<p class="css">
		A developer should create a file with the following syntax "nameOfTheScript.js" and they should make sure it has that .js filename extension 
		so that it will be recognized as JavaScript file. Next is that when a developer is inside the HTML, he or she can easily call the script file 
		by putting &#60;script src="nameOfTheScript.js"&#62; &#60;/script&#62; inside the HTML file. Both the HTML and the javaScript file should be placed inside 
		the same folder.
		</p>
		<h3 class="head5">Comments</h3>
		<p class="css">
		A developer can write comments the JavaScript code which will be ignored by the browser and it would be useful of you want to provide guidelines 
		and instructions on how the JavaScript works to some of your fellow developers. <br>
		<br> single line : written after a double forward slash (//this is a comment) <br>
		multi-line  : written between the strings (/* this is also a comment */)
		</p>
		<h3 class="head6"><center>JavaScript Language Fundamentals</center></h3>
		<p class="css">
		In JavaScript, you have to separate the statements on a single line by using a semi-colon. Semi-colon that is usually found on the end of the line 
		determines where the statement is ending.
		</p>
		<h3 class="head5">Variables and Constants</h3>
		<p class="css">
		You can store values inside a container called Variables. You just have to declare the variable with the use of var keyword and it should be 
		followed by any name that you have chosen.
		</p>
		<p class="codeID">
		<code>var myVariable;</code>
		</p>
		<p class="css">
		You can declare also by using a let keyword but the difference with the var is that, it does not become a property of the Window object. 
		Both of var and let are global scope.
		</p>
		<p class="codeID">
		<code>let yourVariable;</code>
		</p>
		<p class="css">
		For the declaration of Constants, you make use of const keyword and then followed by the name of the constant. 
		It is a global scope but it does not become a property of the Window object.
		</p>
		<p class="codeID">
		<code>const sampleName = 'Jo';</code>
		</p>
		<p class="css">
		One thing that you should not do in declaring variable and constants is something like this:
		</p>
		<p class="codeID">
		<code>avoidThis = 100; </code>
		</p>
		<p class="css">
		Because it is made implicitly if non-existent and it will serve as the global reference to window property. 
		</p>
		<p class="def">
		Variables and constants may contain values which have different data types such as String, Number, Boolean, Array, and Object.
		</p>
		<p class="css">
		String is a sequence of text. The value should be enclosed in quote marks. Example:
		</p>
		<p class="codeID">
		<code>var stringName = 'Christine'; //With single-quotes <br> 
			  var stringNames = "Tagle"; //With double-quotes <br>
			  var heading = `${stringName}+${stringNames} is addicted`; //With template literals
	    </code>
		</p>
		<p class="css">
		Numbers do not have quotes around the value. Example:
		</p>
		<p class="codeID">
		<code>var numberName = 11; //For decimal integer <br>
	          discount = 0.50; //For decimal floating point <br> 
	          atomsPerMole = 7.011e23; //For decimal scientific notation <br>
		<br>
		For the numbers in base 2, 8, and 16: <br>
	          var binaryNo = 0b1101; //In declaring binary number <br>
			  octalNo = 0123; //In declaring octal numbers <br>
			  hexadecimalNo = 0xABC; //In declaring hexadecimal numbers <br>
		<br>
        For the special numbers like: <br>
	          var positiveInfinity = 1 / 0; //Infinity <br>
			  negativeInfinity = -1 / 0; //-Infinity <br>
			  notANumber = 0 / 0; //Nan <br>
		<br>
		Not that division is always floating-point<br>
		console.log(5 / 2);
		<br>
		and be aware of not exact floating-point arithmetic like<br>
		console.log(0.3 - 0.2);
	    </code>
		</p>
		<p class="css">
		Boolean values does not need quotes around them and the true and false words are special keywords on JavaScript.
		</p>
		<p class="codeID">
		<code>var booleanName = false;
	    </code>
		</p>
		<p class="css">
		Null and undefined<br>
		Declared by using the null and undefined keywords.
		</p>
		<p class="codeID">
		<code>var sample = null; <br>
			  var meaning, dictionary = undefined;
	    </code>
		</p>
		<p class="css">
		Array will allow you to store many values on one single reference.
		</p>
		<p class="codeID">
		<code>var arrayName = [1,'Christine','Janine',10]; </code>
		</p>
		<p class="css">
		Object is seen anywhere in the JavaScript code because everything in JavaScript are objects. Objects can be stored on a variable. 
		Just like in Java, you make use of the new keyword for instantiate an object.
		</p>
		<p class="codeID">
		<code>
			var objectName = document.querySelector('h2'); <br>
			var reaction = new String('Gosh'); <br>
			var grade = new Number(99); <br>
			var status = new Boolean(false); <br>
			var s1 = 'Christine', s2 = new String('Tagle'); <br>
			<br>
			//And if will be checked then the result will be a:
			<br>
			//string<br>
			console.log(typeof s1);	<br>	
			//object<br>
			console.log(typeof s2); <br>
		</p>
		<p class="css">
		Date Object
		</p>
		<p class="codeID">
		<code>
			var d1 = new Date(); //For the current client,environment date and time <br>
			var d2 = new Date(2018, 3, 1); //This would result to April 1, 2018, 12:00 MN <br>
		</code>
		</p>
		<p class="css">
		Math Object<br>
		- It makes use something like Math.sqrt(parameter, Math.PI, Math.trunc(parameter), and Math.random().
		</p>
		<h3 class="head5">JSON Object</h3>
		<p class="css">
		The JSON object allows object conversions to and from JSON-formatted strings. Example:
		</p>
		<p class="codeID">
		<code>
			var obj = JSON.stringify(student);<br>
			console.log(obj);<br>
			<br>
			var str = `<br>
						{<br>
						"description": "3D Origin",<br>
						"x-coords": 0,<br>
						"y-coords": 0,<br>
						"z-coords": 0<br>
						}`;<br>
			<br>
			var obj = JSON.parse(str);<br>
			console.log(obj);<br>
		</code>
		</p>
		<h3 class="head5">Operators (-, *, /)</h3>
		<p class="css">
		Addition(+) <br>
		It is used to glue two strings or add two numbers.
		Example:
		</p>
		<p class="codeID">
		<code>
			1 + 2; <br>
			"Britanny" + "Banina!"; <br>
		</code>
		</p>
		<p class="css">
		Subtraction, Multiplication, Division (-, *, /) <br>	
		It performs subtraction, multiplication, and division on numbers like what they do in basic math. The multiply in JavaScript is represented by an asterisk.	
		Example:
		</p>
		<p class="codeID">
		<code>
			9 - 6;<br>
			2 * 2;<br>
			6 / 3;<br>
		</code>
		</p>
		<p class="css">
		Assignment (=) <br>
		The assigning a value into a variable.	
		Example:
		</p>
		<p class="codeID">
		<code>
			var assignmentName = 'Nicole';
		</code>
		</p>
		<p class="css">
		Equality (===) <br>
		Use for checking the equality between two things and will result any of Boolean result which are true or false.	
		Example:
		</p>
		<p class="codeID">
		<code>
			var peraKo = 3; <br>
			peraKo === 4;
		</code>
		</p>
		<p class="css">
		Does-not-equal or Not (!, !==) <br>
		It is used to reverse the value of a thing. Whenever it is used together with the Equality operator, The two values are determined by the negation operator if it is not equal. True is the basic expression but if will negate it then it will be false.
		Example:
		</p>
		<p class="codeID">
		<code>
			var checkIt = 3; <br>
			!(checkIt === 3); <br>
			checkIt !== 3;
		</code>
		</p>
		<p class="css">
		Conditionals <br>
		For test whether an expression returns true or not, Conditionals code structures are used.It will reveal alternative code by if it does not satisfy its result.If-else statement is a very common form. 
		Example:
		</p>
		<p class="codeID">
		<code>
			var cake = 'big';<br>
			if (cake === 'small') {<br>
			alert('Yay this is perfect for me, I'm on diet');<br>
			} else {<br>
			alert('Awww it's so huge');<br>
			}<br>
			//If the result of the comparison is false then the first block will be skipped and after the else statement which is the second block should run instead.
		</code>
		</p>
		<p class="css">
		Functions <br>
		It's a way of collection of functionality that you want to reuse in the future. Instead of spending so much time rewriting a code, you could just call the name of the function when you need a procedure.
		Example:
		</p>
		<p class="codeID">
		<code>
			 var sampleName = document.querySelector('h1'); <br>
			 alert('alert is a function!');
		</code>
		</p>
		<p class="css">
		When you encounter a variable name that has parentheses after it then is it a function. For the functions to do their job, they often get arguments which are the bits of data. Argument go inside the parentheses, if it is more than one then it will be separated by comma. 
		Example:
		</p>
		<p class="codeID">
		<code>
			 function add(num1,num2) { <br>
			 var sum = num1 + num2;<br>
			 return sum;<br>
			}
		</code>
		</p>
		<h3 class="head5">Events</h3>
		<p class="css">
		Website really needs events to have a real interactivity.
		Events are code structures that listens for things that are currently happening in browser and running code as a reply or in response. 
		Example would be the click event that is offered by the browser when you are about to click on something with the use of your mouse. 
		</p>
		<h3 class="head5">Sets</h3>
		<p class="css">
		It is a collections of some values. Through the elements of on a set in insertion order, you can iterate it. 
		Only one time that the value of the set may appear and it is considered  as the unique thing on Set's collection. Example:
		</p>
		<p class="codeID">
		<code>
			const set1 = new Set([1, 2, 3, 4, 5]); <br>
			<br>
		//The expected output would be true<br>
		console.log(set1.has(1));<br>
		<br>
		//The expected output would be true<br>
		console.log(set1.has(5));<br>
		<br>
		//The expected output would be false<br>
		console.log(set1.has(6));<br>
		</code>
		</p>
		<h3 class="head5">Maps</h3>
		<p class="css">
		It iterates each of its elements in insertion order. A developer should always remember that a Map that is a map of an object will only map 
		to the insertion order of the object that is not ordered.

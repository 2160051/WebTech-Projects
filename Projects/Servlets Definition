Servlets
	Servlets runs and enabled in a java server which is also a Java class. An HTTP servlet is a special type of servlet that handles an HTTP 
  request and provides an HTTP response, usually in the form of an HTML page. The most common use of WebLogic HTTP servlets is to create 
  interactive applications using standard Web browsers for the client-side presentation while WebLogic Server handles the business logic 
  as a server-side process. WebLogic HTTP servlets can access databases, Enterprise JavaBeans, messaging APIs, HTTP sessions, and other 
  facilities of WebLogic Server.
  
 Servlets and Java EE
	With Java EE metadata annotations, the standard web.xml deployment descriptor is now optional. The Servlet 2.5 specification, 
	states annotations can be defined on certain Web components, such as servlets, filters, listeners, and tag handlers. The 
	annotations are used to declare dependencies on external resources. The container will detect annotations on such components and 
	inject necessary dependencies before the component's life cycle methods are invoked. See Chapter 8, "WebLogic Annotation for Web 
	Components".

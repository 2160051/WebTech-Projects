  request and provides an HTTP response, usually in the form of an HTML page. The most common use of WebLogic HTTP servlets is to create 
  interactive applications using standard Web browsers for the client-side presentation while WebLogic Server handles the business logic 
  as a server-side process. WebLogic HTTP servlets can access databases, Enterprise JavaBeans, messaging APIs, HTTP sessions, and other 
  facilities of WebLogic Server.

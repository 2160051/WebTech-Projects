Hello Sir! This is our folder for the requirements. 

A. Viewing our website:
In order to view our website, please enter the folder named website then 
double click the html file titled prelims. 

Inside prelims.html, there is a navigation bar on the left side. You may use that to navigate. 
Also on the rightmost bottom part of the website is a small arrow pointing up. This arrow
will take you on the topmost part of the site to see the left navigation bar immediately.

B. About the other websites:
There are other websites, namely index, midterms and finals but those are not done yet
or are under construction. The references html file contains all the references we used
for the website. 

Thank you for viewing sir.

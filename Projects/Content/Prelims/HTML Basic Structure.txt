HTML BASIC STRUCTURE

DOCTYPE
<!DOCTYPE HTML> which is usually found at the very top of the page before any HTML tags, is called a document type declaration that identifies the document and tells the browser that it is in HTML5 version. This doc type should appear only once at the beginning of the code and the declaration is not case sensitive. <!DOCTYPE HTML> helps the browsers to display the pages of the web in a correct manner or way.

HTML Root Element

The <HTML> serves as the root element that defines the whole HTML document. It holds all of the code and wraps the content in the HTML document. It identifies which the web page is written in HTML. It usually contains each of <head> and <body> elements. The </HTML> tag is the sign that it is the end of the web page. When a web developer used element something like this, <HTML lang="en">, it means that it declares that language of the document is English.

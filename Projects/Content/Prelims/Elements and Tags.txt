The <head> element is responsible in containing the meta information of the HTML document and the <title> element that is the only element required to be put inside the <head> tags which indicates the title for the document or simply specifies the web page title.  This <head> element could also include a lot of HTML elements that that cannot be seen as parts of the page when rendered by the browser. These elements are either meta data or are the things that is helping in pulling the external resources like JavaScript files or CSS style sheets.The HTML elemenets which can be used by a web developer that can be put inside the <head> element are the <base>, <link>,<noscript>,<style>,<meta>,<title> and the <script>.
